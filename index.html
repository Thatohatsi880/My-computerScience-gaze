        "The history of computer science began long before the modern discipline of computer science, 
        usually appearing in forms like mathematics or physics. Developments in previous centuries alluded 
        to the discipline that we now know as computer science. This progression, from mechanical inventions 
        and mathematical theories towards modern computer concepts and machines, led to the development of a 
        major academic field, massive technological advancement across the Western world, and the basis of a 
        massive worldwide trade and culture."
